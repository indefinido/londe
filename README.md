### Transform in gem
A binary can be created to generate the entire application, like:
```shell
  londe new application_name
```

### Support to RVM
Once it becomes a gem, we can set the entire ruby environment before running the Rails generator.


### Use variables across steps during setup
Like getting some output from the setup step and use to save later as instructions.
